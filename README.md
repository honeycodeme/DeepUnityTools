# AI and Deep learning tools for Unity using CNTK

## Note
This project was developed for Aalto University's Computational Intelligence in Games course material. 

The development is stopped now, because we decided to use Tensorflowsharp with Unity MLAgent instead of CNTK for multiplatform support. The new project will be in public soon. [Here](https://github.com/tcmxx/UnityTensorflowKeras).
